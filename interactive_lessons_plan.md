# Interactive Lessons Upgrade Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to transform the current, primarily static Bachata App lessons into highly-interactive learning experiences.  The plan is broken down into product-level ideas (learner experience) and the technical work required in this repository to implement them.

---
## 1. Product-Level Features

1. **Check-Point Questions**  
   ‚Ä¢ Single-question pop-ups after major paragraphs ("Did you get it?").  
   ‚Ä¢ Instant feedback, progress bar tick & confetti on success.

2. **Inline Audio / Rhythm Challenges**  
   ‚Ä¢ Solo-instrument player: learners toggle layers (bongo, g√ºira, bass) on/off.  
   ‚Ä¢ Waveform with draggable markers ("Drop a pin where the martillo accents land").  
   ‚Ä¢ Drag-and-drop instrument names onto a band diagram.

3. **Interactive Timelines (History Lessons)**  
   ‚Ä¢ Horizontal decade slider (1950 ‚Üí 2020) revealing text, images & 15-second Spotify embeds.  
   ‚Ä¢ Keyboard arrows / swipe to advance.

4. **Glossary Flash-Cards & Hover-Pop Definitions**  
   ‚Ä¢ Glossary terms flip a card on click; "Got it / Need Review" feeds a spaced-repetition queue.  
   ‚Ä¢ Hover on desktop, long-press on mobile.

5. **Branching "Choose-Your-Path" Walk-throughs**  
   ‚Ä¢ Learner picks between, e.g., *Dominican Folk* vs *Urban Fusion* tracks; component renders only the chosen branch plus a mini-map.

6. **Gamification Layer**  
   ‚Ä¢ XP points & badges ("Rhythm Rookie", "History Buff").  
   ‚Ä¢ Weekly streak & share-to-social CTA.  
   ‚Ä¢ End-of-lesson scorecard with animated progress ring.

7. **Community / Social**  
   ‚Ä¢ Emoji reactions or comment thread on each content-block.  
   ‚Ä¢ Leaderboard sorted by completion percentage.

## 2. Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ **Phase 1 - COMPLETED (June 2025)**
**Check-Point Questions (Single-Question Pop-ups)**
- ‚úÖ Extended TypeScript types with `InteractiveBlock` discriminated union
- ‚úÖ Created `InlineQuiz` component with confetti celebrations and instant feedback
- ‚úÖ Added interactive quiz support to both `HistoryLessonView` and `MusicLessonView`
- ‚úÖ Built modular `createQuiz` helper function for consistent quiz generation
- ‚úÖ **Deployed across ALL lessons:**
  - **History Lessons (11 quizzes total):**
    - `history-50-60`: 3 quizzes on origins, instruments, pioneers
    - `history-70-80`: 3 quizzes on underground status, electric revolution, urbanization
    - `history-90-00`: 3 quizzes on Juan Luis Guerra, urban bachata, diaspora
    - `history-10-20`: 3 quizzes on digital breakthrough, dance styles, UNESCO
  - **Music Lessons (8 quizzes total):**
    - `music-instruments`: 3 quizzes on core instruments, requinto, bass patterns
    - `music-rhythm`: 3 quizzes on rhythm types, derecho placement, mambo characteristics
    - `music-structure`: 2 quizzes on verse rhythm, mambo section features

**Features Implemented:**
- Beautiful blue-themed quiz UI with question mark icons
- Instant visual feedback (green checkmarks, red X marks)
- Educational explanations after each answer
- Celebratory confetti animations on correct answers
- Seamless integration within lesson content flow

### üöß **Phase 2 - Audio/Rhythm Challenges & Drag-and-Drop Exercises**
**Audio/Rhythm Challenges:**
- ‚òê Solo-Mute Mixer in music-instruments lesson (4-stem audio player with solo/mute buttons)
- ‚òê Pin-the-Accent inline in music-rhythm lesson (waveform with draggable accent markers)
- ‚òê Tap-the-Tempo quiz in Music section (circular tap button for tempo matching)
- ‚òê Fill-the-Gap Audio Cloze (identify missing instrument from audio loop)

**Drag-and-Drop Exercises:**
- ‚úÖ Label-the-Band inline in music-instruments lesson (drag instrument names onto stage silhouettes)
- ‚òê Arrange-the-Sections quiz in Music section (drag song structure cards into correct order)
- ‚òë Build-a-Clave inline in music-rhythm lesson (interactive beat grid with audio playback)
- ‚òê Decade Timeline Scramble quiz in History section (drag historical events onto timeline)

**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ Build-a-Clave: Implemented as an interactive click-based grid (not drag-and-drop) with Web Audio API synthesis, real-time playback, pattern validation, and confetti celebration. Successfully integrated into the music-rhythm lesson after the derecho section.
- ‚úÖ Build-Mambo-Pattern: Created specialized component for mambo rhythm with sixteenth note subdivisions, featuring authentic "a caballo" pattern with proper "1 e & a" beat labeling and rapid triplet-like groupings.
- ‚úÖ Build-the-Rhythms Quiz: Implemented as a standalone quiz in the Music section, combining all three rhythm building exercises (derecho, majao, mambo) into a comprehensive assessment with progress tracking and completion celebration.
- ‚úÖ Label-the-Band: Enhanced implementation with audio-visual learning! Students drag interactive audio players (not text labels) onto instrument silhouettes (not text prompts). Features include: Web Audio API playback for instrument identification, **highly accurate research-based SVG silhouettes** for visual recognition, drag-and-drop using react-dnd, beautiful stage background with lighting effects, real-time feedback, and confetti celebration. **[Dec 28, 2024 Update]**: All silhouettes have been refined for maximum clarity and recognizability. The bass guitar in particular has been completely redesigned to accurately reflect a modern electric bass, creating a true learning challenge that tests both auditory and visual instrument recognition skills.

### üöß **Next Phases - Planned**
- **Phase 3**: Interactive timelines for history lessons
- **Phase 4**: Gamification and community features

## 3. Technical Implementation

### 3.1 Content Schema Updates (TypeScript) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
1. ‚úÖ Extended `Section` in `src/types/Lesson.ts` with:
   ```ts
   interactiveBlocks?: InteractiveBlock[];
   ```
2. ‚úÖ Added discriminated-union type:
   ```ts
   type InteractiveBlock =
     | { kind: 'quiz'; id: string; data: InlineQuizData }
     | { kind: 'audio-layer'; tracks: AudioLayer[] }     // Future
     | { kind: 'drag-labels'; image: string; labels: Label[] }  // Future
     | { kind: 'timeline'; events: TimelineEvent[] }     // Future
     | { kind: 'flashcard'; termIds: string[] };         // Future
   ```

### 3.2 Lesson Component Enhancements ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
* ‚úÖ Updated `HistoryLessonView` component to render interactive blocks
* ‚úÖ Updated `MusicLessonView` component to render interactive blocks  
* ‚úÖ Created modular `createQuiz` helper function in `src/utils/quizHelpers.ts`
* ‚úÖ Integrated `InlineQuiz` component seamlessly within lesson content

### 3.3 New Reusable Components
| Component              | Status | Key Tech / Libs          | Purpose |
|------------------------|--------|--------------------------|---------|
| `InlineQuiz`           | ‚úÖ **DONE** | React, CSS animations, confetti | Single Q&A pop-ups |
| `AudioLayerPlayer`     | üöß Planned | `wavesurfer.js`          | Solo/mute instrument layers, markers |
| `DragLabelBoard`       | üöß Planned | `react-dnd`              | Drag-and-drop naming tasks |
| `HistoryTimeline`      | üöß Planned | `react-horizontal-timeline` or CSS scroll-snap | Era slider |
| `GlossaryFlashcards`   | üöß Planned | `framer-motion`          | Card-flip, spaced repetition |

### 3.4 Global State & Persistence (Future Phases)
* Introduce `ProgressContext` (wrap `AppLayout`).
* Persist per-block completion in `localStorage` via `progressManager` upgrade (`sectionId.lessonId.blockId ‚Üí { completed: true }`).
* **Phase-2**: sync to Firebase for cross-device progress.

### 3.5 Gamification Module (Future Phases)
* `useGamification()` hook returns XP, badges, streak.  
* Trigger badge toast via `react-hot-toast` & confetti via `canvas-confetti`.

### 3.6 UX / Accessibility Polishing (Future Phases)
* Lazy-load heavy embeds; use `react-intersection-observer` for in-view mounts.  
* Ensure ARIA labels & keyboard navigation for drag targets.  
* Dark-mode parity for all new components.

---
## 8. Future Experiments and A/B Testing

### Quiz Placement Strategy
- **Hypothesis**: The timing and placement of quizzes significantly impact user engagement, comprehension, and lesson completion rates.
- **Current Approach**: Quizzes are currently placed *before* the detailed content they test, acting as a "priming" mechanism.
- **Alternative Approach**: Place quizzes *after* the relevant content to act as a knowledge check and reinforcement tool.
- **Proposed Test**:
  - **A/B Test**: Implement functionality to serve two versions of a lesson to different user segments.
    - **Group A (Control)**: Receives the current implementation (quiz before content).
    - **Group B (Variant)**: Receives the modified version (quiz after content).
  - **Metrics to Collect**:
    - **Engagement**: Time spent on page, lesson completion rate.
    - **Learning Efficacy**: First-try answer accuracy on quizzes.
    - **Qualitative Feedback**: Add a simple "Was this helpful?" survey after each interactive block.
- **Goal**: Use data from this experiment to determine the optimal quiz placement strategy for maximizing learning and engagement across the app.
